// Big question here is whether to seperate js files based on function.  While we're not going
// for an SPA type site, we would like significant interactivity with the pages we do direct 
// from.  Ideally we'll keep all shared functionality in this, with supplementals for domains
// like calendar or media.

function getCalendar(){
